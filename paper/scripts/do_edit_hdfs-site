# hdfs-site.xml specifies each host in the cluster. In our case, we will be hosting our NameNode and DataNode on the same system. So, we must create directories to hold each accordingly.

$ mkdir -p /usr/local/hadoop_store/hdfs/namenode
$ mkdir -p /usr/local/hadoop_store/hdfs/datanode

# Now we most tell Hadoop how many replicas of block storage we want the DataNode to keep as well as where these directories are by adding the following between the <configuration></configuration> tags

<property>
  <name>dfs.replication</name>
  <value>1</value>
</property>
<property>
  <name>dfs.namenode.name.dir</name>
  <value>file:/usr/local/hadoop_store/hdfs/namenode</value>
</property>
<property>
  <name>dfs.datanode.data.dir</name>
  <value>file:/usr/local/hadoop_store/hdfs/datanode</value>
